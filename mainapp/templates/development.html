                        <h3>About Development </h3>
                        <p>Development includes building technical front-end and/or back-end code that informs site
                            functionality. Web developers may work exclusively on front-end code, back-end code, or
                            both, and many modern jobs also require overlap in web design. These professionals may work
                            independently on a freelance basis or with marketing or IT departments.
                            The front end includes designing sites and coding what users see, while back-end development involves writing code to ensure proper functionality.

            The objective of Virtual Labs IIT Roorkee is to involve the community to re-think on the best
            practices regarding pedagogy, storyboards, lab manuals, documentation and the technologies for
            building a high quality simulator.

            The main activities of this portal are content creation through community, hosting the community
            created content, the source codes, hackathons for code and content development, events for
            instructors for pedagogy and storyboard design.

            Stakeholders & Beneficiaries
            The academic community of students and instructors from Engineering, Science and Polytechnic
            institutes are the potential stakeholders as well as the beneficiaries. The objective is to provide
            quality Virtual Lab experiences for education.

            Content creation
            The data collected through major universities in India indicates that, there are over 500 Labs which
            need to be created; (only ~120 labs of the MOE Virtual Labs project are available for use).
            Therefore, there exists a huge gap in the syllabus which has to be filled by the community itself.
