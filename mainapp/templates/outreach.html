      <li>The labs that have been developed at virtual labs under various developemnt programs must be used and access.
      </li>
      <li> Thus, to make aware the students and faculty across India about these labs, we organize various outreach
        activities of the Virtual Labs.</li>
      <li> Under the outreach activities, we organize workshops at the engineering Colleges/Institutes with consent and
        corporation of the willing participating institutes/organizations. </li>
      <li>In this regard, we would like to convey to you that, if you are interested to make students, studying at your
        college, aware about the Virtual Labs experiments, we will be pleased to arrange a workshop (online as well as
        offline as per the situation at then) at your College/Institute. </li>

      <li>To provide remote-access to Labs in various disciplines of Science and Engineering.
        These Virtual Labs would cater to first year students at the undergraduate level.</li>
      <li> To enthuse students to conduct experiments by arousing their curiosity. This would help
        them in learning basic and advanced concepts through remote experimentation.
      </li>
      <li>To provide a complete Learning Management System around the Virtual Labs where students can avail the various
        tools for learning, including additional web resources,
        video-lectures, animated demonstrations and self-evaluation. </li>
      <li>To share costly equipment and resources, which are otherwise available to limited
        number of users due to constraints on time and geographical distance. </li>
